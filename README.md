# ShapeWeaver ðŸŽ¨

An intelligent digital artist that transforms hand-drawn shapes into mesmerizing space-filling curves using deep learning.

## Overview

ShapeWeaver is a generative art project that sits at the intersection of computer vision, sequence modeling, and interactive design. Users draw simple closed shapes, and the AI automatically "weaves" continuous, non-intersecting lines that perfectly fill the interior of those shapes, visualized as captivating real-time animations.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Synthetic Dataset Generation
- Generate thousands of random polygon shapes as 256x256 binary masks
- Create corresponding space-filling curves using clipped Hilbert curves
- Build paired dataset of shape images and curve coordinates

### Phase 2: Model Architecture & Training
- **Encoder**: CNN that processes shape images into context vectors
- **Decoder**: LSTM that generates ordered sequences of curve points
- Train end-to-end on synthetic dataset

### Phase 3: Interactive Application
- Web-based drawing canvas for user input
- Real-time model inference
- Animated curve visualization
